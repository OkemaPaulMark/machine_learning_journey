# 🤖 My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome! This project represents my practical journey into **machine learning**, showcasing what I've learned/learning and implemented across both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques.

It brings together various models, preprocessing tools, evaluation metrics — a hands-on demonstration of concepts I learned through my **recess term** and personal exploration.

## 🧠 What I am learning/Learned

### 🔷 Supervised Learning

This is where my journey began. I explored algorithms that learn from labeled data to make predictions and classifications:

- **Linear Regression**: My foundation in regression — I used it to understand how continuous predictions work.
- **Logistic Regression**: I was also able to try out Logistic Regression and foundout its difference with Linear Regression
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: My introduction to deep learning. I trained CNNs to work with image data and extract patterns automatically with guidance from our Supervisor.

Along the way, I learned:
- How to preprocess data using tools like `LabelEncoder`, `StandardScaler`, and `CountVectorizer`
- How to evaluate models using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**

### 🔶 Unsupervised Learning

After grasping supervised techniques, I began exploring unsupervised learning to find hidden structures in unlabeled data:

- **Clustering** (e.g., K-Means): To group similar data points without prior labels

This phase of learning helped me shift from prediction to **pattern discovery**.

##The Journey is not yet over and am still learning and building on my knowledge in **🤖 Machine Learning**
